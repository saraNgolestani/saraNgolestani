### Hi there
- âš¡ Proficient in designing, training, and deploying machine learning models, including neural networks and deep learning architectures, for diverse applications such as object detection, natural language processing (NLP), and resource usage forecasting. Adept at creating efficient data processing pipelines for complex datasets, including 3D point cloud data, and extracting meaningful features for machine learning tasks. Hands-on experience in developing end-to-end ML pipelines, from data preprocessing to model deployment, utilizing Azure and Docker for scalability and efficiency.
- ðŸŒ± Here is an explanation to the things I've done so far:
- During my Masters as a research assitance in the field of machine learning engineer with my focus on computer visions , I did	Object detection with the help of Multitask Learning (MTL) to improve the Mask R-CNNs ability to detect small objects on UAV data with higher accuracy. This method was applied on backbone of these object detection methods to enrich their output feature maps. The Object detection methods used for improving the Map in object detection on UAV data were YOLO, Mask R-CNN, and DETR.

- During my tenure as an Associate Machine Learning Developer at AltaML, I successfully implemented Github actions to an ML Bootcamp project reducing the reviewing time by more than 50%. I also have experience in developing automated model training and deployment workflows, reducing the time required for model deployment by 50%.
- In my previous role as an Artificial Intelligence Specialist at Fanap Co, I played a key role in implementing machine learning algorithms for accurate resource usage forecasting for the SAKKU Platform. I also enhanced user experience by implementing a file search feature, which received positive feedback from clients and users.

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm seeking a new position in Machine Learning/ Data Science field to continue my career in ML and DS.
